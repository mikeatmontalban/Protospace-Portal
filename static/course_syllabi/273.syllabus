&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protospace gets messy. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no way around that, even if everybody was perfect at cleaning up after their projects, eventually extra cleaning would be required. Often these cleans are done by the same few members who get frustrated with the lack of help. Often these cleans are done at random times that other members have no way of finding out about and be available to help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protospace is member-run. This means we all have to contribute to the operation, and membership dues are only part of the equation. If you do not actively contribute to making Protospace better in some way, then you are NOT doing enough to justify your membership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These cleanups are a great way for anybody to contribute to keeping Protospace clean and presentable, both for members to use, and for guests and prospective members to see. With the festival and exhibit season upon us we expect to more guests every week. Having the space be clean and presentable is imperative to member signups and retention. We need to be sure that the facility is safe and tidy for everybody. And, sometimes, major changes occur&amp;nbsp;at Protospace primarily by the efforts of a handful of members (like the materials rack, ceiling fixes, sorting donations, painting&amp;hellip; etc.), and other people don&#39;t know what&#39;s been changed or where things are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are going to use this as an opportunity to set a specific task to be accomplished while many people are available to help. These tasks may be specific cleaning tasks, or they may be infrastructure or organizational tasks. To allow for input from everybody, suggestions and discussion about what the specific goal should be will be taken at the monthly meeting prior. If you notice something that you think could be improved but aren&#39;t able to handle it on your own, come to the monthly meeting and suggest it. If you want to help out but don&#39;t know where to start, come to the monthly meeting and add to the discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having a group of people show up together who also know what they specifically want to accomplish, will give us the ability to make pretty significant improvements to Protospace every single month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And&amp;hellip; &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There will be food&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a thank you for those who come out and help, if you put a few hours into cleaning up, you get lunch for free! Food may change, but probably burgers or pizza &amp;ndash; suggestions welcome. Lunch will start at around 1:00 which allows people to help clean, get lunch, and still have the second half of the day free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is not that every member must come out every month! Rather, this structure provides a consistent and predictable time for people to contribute when they are available. If you can&amp;rsquo;t make a month, that&#39;s not a problem &amp;ndash; but if you could plan a few hours into your schedule to help out &amp;ndash; at the cleanup or on your own &amp;ndash; that would be a huge benefit to Protospace!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more people that come out, the more that will be accomplished, and the less time it will take.&lt;/p&gt;
