&lt;p&gt;Join Byron to learn how to make an LED strip clock (like the model in the electronics room). The course fee includes a microcontroller (ESP 8266), LED strip, bits and pieces, instructions and some vinyl numbers for your clock &quot;face&quot;. You&#39;ll need to bring or scrounge for an wooded or acrylic &quot;base&quot;. You&#39;ll need to find a 5V power supply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since this is as much an art project as a tech one, you can choose to arrange your clock differently (perhaps a circle or hexagon?), and customize the display. Working code will be provided.&lt;/p&gt;
