&lt;p&gt;This course will qualify you to use the jointer, thickness planer and drum sanders. These tools are used to take a piece of lumber from a rough-sawn state to an accurately-dimensioned and finished state. You will be informed on selection of appropriate beginning stock and be given hands-on exposure to using the tools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You must take &quot;Woodworking Tools I: Stationary Saws&quot; before taking this course.&lt;/p&gt;
