&lt;p&gt;Do you consider&amp;nbsp;Halloween to be &quot;the most wonderful time of the year&quot;? Do you think a Dremel tool and a reciprocating saw are essential tools for pumpkin carving? Have you wanted to put blinking lights or spooky sounds into your Jack-O-Latern? Have you wanted to teach your younglings how to make a creation worthy of display on your porch? Or, are you bored with nothing better to do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can answer yes to any of these questions, come join us as we make a giant pumpkin mess in the workshop. We&#39;ll have some pumpkin carving tools, some templates, some ideas, and a place to work (the whole idea behind Protospace). You can make extreme creations, or the most basic face. There might even be a prize for best carving... or maybe for worst carving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come out and have some fall fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No charge for members, $20 for non-members. Bring your own pumpkin (organic [&quot;real&quot;] or craft type [&quot;funkins&quot;]. Contact the instructor if you want to arrange a group pick-up of pumpkins.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
