This seminar will update your skills for using our &quot;new&quot; Torrent lathe.

It is recommended for anyone who has taken lathe training before August 2015. The update deals only with the specific controls and accessories on the Torrent and assumes lathe experience. It is not mandatory to use the Torrent, but highly recommended.

Any number of people can attend (whatever we can fit into the room upstairs). They can attend whether or not they have taken the lathe course, but when they do take the full course, they will have to sit though that section again -- as it is basically the last section of the lathe course.
