&lt;p&gt;This hand-ons Geek-fest explores and demonstrates the poor security practices commonly found in some RFID access systems (Yes, we use an RFID access system. No, we don&#39;t use these same poor practices.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will be introduced to RFID access systems, the Wiegand protocol, programing of the BLE key and replay attacks. The BLE Key is a tiny coin-cell operated Bluetooth device -- that you get to keep. The BLE Key is an open-source educational tool. This lab will focus on the interaction between the BLE Key, RFID and the Wiegand protocol.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BLE Key is already assembled, (thanks, Ben!) so this workshop requires no electronics experience, and some programming experience is nice, but not necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The workshop consists of a 30 minute theory presentation and 90 minutes hands on&amp;nbsp;with the hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost of the workshop includes your own BLE key, card readers will be available during the lab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This course will be presented by Ben Reed, former Protospace director and long term member, based in part on work done at SAIT&#39;s RADLab. (See&amp;nbsp;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THqVshaNb5g)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cost for members: $60, Non-members: $85.&lt;br /&gt;Non-members may email info@protospace.ca to register.&lt;/p&gt;
