&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #222222;&quot;&gt;Making Makers: Workshops for Educators&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Projects that incorporate electronics really stand out, and they can make the creative process more fun. Adding simple electronics to a project can be fast and easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Teachers will leave this workshop with a practical understanding of basic electronic circuits -- the one that make things light-up, make sound, and make things move. Our focus is on solutions that let students using basic, common, low-cost electronic components to enhance projects in fun and clever ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Teachers will also leave with a selection of parts and components to put to use. A light snack and beverages is included; the session will last about 3 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;These workshops are hands-on experiences to help develop better understanding of subject matter, and to make them more fun&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-image: initial; background-position: initial; background-size: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial;&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
