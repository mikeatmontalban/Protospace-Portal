Mead is the oldest known form of alcohol.  It&#39;s also one of the easiest forms of alcohol to make.  You will learn how to make a batch from start to finish, as well as understand how the fermenting process works, how to hack it and how to make it your own for under a 10th of what it costs to buy.  If you&#39;ve tried mead and don&#39;t like it, you will still learn cool things from this class including how to tailor a batch to your preference.

You will have the opportunity to have a part in making a batch of mead, or you can bring your own supplies and make your own.
