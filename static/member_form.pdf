Calgary Protospace, Ltd. 
Release of Liability, Waiver of Claims,  
Assumption of Risks and Indemnity Agreement 
(“Release Agreement”) 
ASSUMPT
ION
OF
RISKS
I acknowledge that inherent risks, dangers and hazards exist
 when using hand tools, power tools, supplies, and other 
equipment commonly used in electronics 
construction, fabrication, software desi
gn and other activities hosted by 
Calgary Protospace Inc. (“Protospace”). 
Participation in such activities and/or the use of equipment associated with 
technology design, manufacture and experi
mentation may result in injury, illness, death or damage to personal property. 
These risks and dangers may be caused by other people, including Protospace members, participants, or guests, or by 
accidents, acts of nature or other causes. Risks and dang
ers may arise from foreseeable or unforeseeable causes 
including, but not limited to, electrocution, bu
rns, impalement, and injury from slips or falls. 
I am responsible for my own safety during Protospace’s activities.
This includes ensuring that tools are in proper working 
order, and that tools are used safely and responsibly. I agree not to use any tools I do not know how to use. I agree not to 
use tools or equipment while under the influence of drugs or alcohol. 
I acknowledge that a Protospace 
mem
ber who may be acting as my host or Sponsor and other 
Members of Protospace 
may advise me on safe work practices, but this does 
not constitute training, nor a supervisory relationship.
 I further 
acknowledge that responsibility for safely using Protospace’s facilities, tools or equipment lies entirely on myself.  
Failure to follow reasonable safety protocols or wilful viol
ation of reasonable safety protocols may result in expulsion 
from Protospace facilities. If I am currently a Protospace member, or become one, wilful violation of reasonable safety 
protocols may result in the termination of my membership and/or access rights. 
Until and unless I apply for and am accepted as a full member of Calgary Protospace, 
I u
nderstand that as a Guest, in 
order to access Protospace facilities or space, 
I must be accompanied by a member of Protospace
, and I will not seek to 
access nor to remain in the space unaccompanied, until and unless I have become a member and have been issued my 
own key, key fob, or access card.

We would like to welcome you to the Protospace community! Thank you for
 signing up.
New 
makers
 have a tri
al membership for the first month. During
 this first month, 
you are welcome 
to work on projects 
and 
participate in
 events, 
including training. You are welcome at the space at 
public times, or whenever 
a keyholder
 is  present
. This includes all our Tuesday night
 “Meet and 
Geeks
”, and any 
other times that you arrange
 with 
a keyholder directly
. There are often people in 
and out throughout the evenings and
 especially the weekends.
Here's what you should do next:

Come out to as many 
open ho
